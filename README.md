# Save Your Eyes

This extension try to be as much as accessible as possible. Colors are chosen to have a high contrast so you don't lose track when selecting or coding.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainlulz/saveYourEyes/master/images/HCThemeScreenshot.png)

# Installation

1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. Go to `View -> Extensions`
2. Search for `Save Your Eyes` by **alexlab**
3. Click **Install** to install it.

# Configuration
To have a clean look, I use [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons) and those customisations:
```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "titleBar.activeBackground": "#f3fefe",
    "titleBar.activeForeground": "#0f0f16",
    "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "#0f0f16",
    "titleBar.inactiveForeground": "#f3fefe",
  },
```
